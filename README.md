## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to those interested in fuzzing valid coupon codes for testing and research purposes. Coupon codes are often used by retailers to drive sales and customer engagement, but they can also be a target for security assessments. 

Fuzzing these codes can help identify vulnerabilities in e-commerce platforms and checkout processes, allowing developers to strengthen their systems against potential abuse. This collection of common coupon codes serves as a foundational dataset for fuzz testing, enabling users to explore how different codes may interact with retail APIs and checkout flows.

Whether you're a security researcher, penetration tester, or just curious about how coupon codes function, this repository provides a great starting point for your fuzzing activities.
